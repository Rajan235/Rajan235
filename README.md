<!-- # Hi, I'm Rajan 👋

I'm a final-year Computer Science student passionate about architecting the resilient, scalable, and automated infrastructure that powers modern software. I love diving deep into cloud-native technologies, building CI/CD pipelines that empower developers, and ensuring systems are not just functional, but observable.

My goal is to build a career in **DevOps, Site Reliability, or Systems Engineering**.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on containerizing my projects and deploying them on a Kubernetes cluster.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Terraform to manage infrastructure as code.
- 💬 Ask me about microservices architecture, Kubernetes, or system observability with the Grafana LGTM stack.
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](#) | [Portfolio](#)
- 🏆 Fun Fact: My team and I won 1st place nationwide in the ZS Campus Beats Hackathon 6.0! -->
